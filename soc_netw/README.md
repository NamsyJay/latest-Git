### The Files above are used to create a basic TCP connection

- ```clients.py``` represents to a local machine.
- ```server.py``` represents to a remote machine.

### To ensure a smooth connection

### 1) Open 2 terminals, each for the remote and local machine connection

### 2) Ensure they are both in the right directory (I experienced this challenge)

### 3) Run the server file first, then the server file

        - The server creates the connection and listens for incoming connections.
        - The client connects the server, receives the welcome message and displays it
        - Then the connection closes.

## This is an example of a client-server communication using TCP sockets in Python
